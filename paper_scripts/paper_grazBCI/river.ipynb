    "## 1. The orignal task\n",
    "\n",
    "### Noticeable particularities : \n",
    "- **Two imaging techniques :** FMRI (fine spatial resolution, but slow dynamics) & EEG (lower spatial resolution, excellent temporal resolution). It was a technical challenge to integrate both measure simultaneously (+ online processing)\n",
    "- **Two-dimensional feedback** based on those sensor modalities\n",
    "\n",
    "### The task itself :\n",
    "- Motor imagery Neurofeedback task (right hand)\n",
    "- Sensors : 64 channels EEG + fMRI\n",
    "- Two sub-studies (XP1 and XP2). XP1 (N=10) compared **unimodal** and **bimodal** Neurofeedback. XP2 (N=20) performed **bimodal** NF with a 1D or 2D feedback.\n",
    "- Participants : right-handed, naive, 18/12,  (mean age 33.7 ± 9.9 years old). Only 26 in the public dataset.\n",

The resulting laterality index was calculated during training following : $NF_{MRI}=\\frac{B_{left}(v)}{B_{left}(rest)} - \\frac{B_{right}(v)}{B_{right}(rest)}$, with B the avg of the BOLD signal over the ROI during the trial (v) and at rest. Updated every 2 seconds.\n",
