    "## 1. Introducing the task\n",
    "\n",
    "To demonstrate the ability of the Sophisticated Inference algorithm to predict various behaviours in an explore/exploit environment, we will introduce a environment well known within the Active Inference community : the T-maze environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's picture a mouse in a simple maze :\n",
    "\n",
    "![starting_situation.png](local_resources/tmaze/starting_situation.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This maze consists in two objects (here : a cheese and a mousetrap) that are either on the left or the right branch. The initial position of those objects is determined by the experimenter (you !). Formally, we can note $s_1$ the state relative to the position of the cheese (either left or right). The initial position of the cheese is determined by the following probability distribution : $D_1 = [p_{init},1-p_{init}]$ and will not change during a trial.\n",
    "\n",
    "The mouse may be in four different places : on its starting position (0),on the bottom of the maze (1), on the left(2) or on the right (3). Let's call this second state $s_2$. Initially, the value of $s_2$ is always 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "The mouse always wants to get to observe cheese as fast as possible and wants to stay away from observing the mousetrap. How much the mouse is looking after the reward and how much it fears the trap is fixed by the experimenter through preference parameters called *reward seeking* (rs)  and *loss aversion* (la).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note :** To discourage greedy mouses, once it has picked either left or right, it is stuck for the remainder of the trial. Therefore, the mouse only has one chance at guessing where the cheese is.\n",
    "\n",
    "This wouldn't be a very interesting setup if we didn't add another dimension to the task : the clue. If the mouse chooses to get to the bottom of the maze, it will receive a clue. Although this clue has no extrinsic reward, it may (or may not) contain some relevant information regarding the position of the cheese. For example, if the clue is good, it will indicate reliably a certain value if the cheese is left and another if the cheese is right.If its not, the observation it provides the mouse will have no correlation with the position of the cheese whatsoever, making it useless. We can picture those clue observation values as arrows pointing towards the right or the left : \n",
    "\n",
    "Reliable clue                           | Unreliable clue                     \n",

    "![](local_resources/tmaze/goodclue.gif) |![](local_resources/tmaze/badclue.gif)\n",
    "\n",
    "The point of this task is to explore how various parameters such as the mouse initial perception of the task or the environmental dynamcis may affect its behaviour : *Should I get the clue,resolving uncertainty but differing my reward ? Should I risk going for the cheese even if I'm not sure about its position ? How good is the clue ?*\n",

Doing this will not modify any behavior and is safe. When replacing `np.int`, you may wish to use e.g. `np.int64` or `np.int32` to specify the precision. If you wish to review your current use, check the release note link for additional information.\nThe aliases was originally deprecated in NumPy 1.20; for more details and guidance see the original release note at:\n    https://numpy.org/devdocs/release/1.20.0-notes.html#deprecations"
