# Active Pynference
Python package for simulating perception, decision-making & learning in uncertain environments using Active Inference (more precisely Sophisticated Inference).

This package started off as a simple Python port of the Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging's SPM12 "MDP_VB_XX" files but we're continuously working on additionnal orignal features ! Work in progress !

What you can do using <b>active-pynference</b> :
- Build your own Active Inference structures (model & process) using a generic <i> layer </i> component
- <i>Link</i> those structures together to simulate environments and various subject models of those environments
- Run simulations of agent behaviour & learning

What you cannot do (yet):
- Use the classical policy comparison scheme (SPM12's MDP_VB_X)
- Fit experimental data to find the optimal parameters
- Find [the answer to life the universe and everything](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/42_(number))
